# Fantastic Phonics schedule

The current schedule generator is a Google Sheet, much like 'Good Morning'.
It requires a multi-step, laborious process involving copy-pasting and manually keeping track of when certain parts were last used
This must be done once a week on a Saturday to produce the schedule for the next week, starting Sunday.
Find it in the 'kyodevteam' Google Drive under:
My Drive > LiveKids > Fantastic Phonics
