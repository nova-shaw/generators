## Current

The current schedule generator is a Google Sheet, much like 'Fantastic Phonics'.

It requires a multi-step, laborious process involving copy-pasting and manually keeping track of when certain parts were last used

This must be done once a week on a Saturday to produce the schedule for the next week, starting Sunday.

Find it in the 'kyodevteam' Google Drive under:  
My Drive > LiveKids > Good Morning > GM Media Randomizer
